# Plagiarized-poster-dateset
It is the first plagiarized artwork dataset created by the didalab of Hunan University. It was published in the paper "Understanding and Identifying Artwork Plagiarism with the Wisdom of Designers: A Case Study on Poster Artwork" in MM22'. All images are collected on the website. Please ONLY use it for academic research.

Please check our lab website to download the full dataset.

***About copyright:*** All images are collected on the Internet. This dataset should only be used for academic research. Commercial use or other acts that may infringe the image's copyright will be strictly prohibited.

***If you are a researcher:*** Please strictly abide by the copyright rules. Again, our dataset is annotated by experts' experiences. Different experts have different boundaries and definitions for design plagiarism. Therefore, we only conclude whether each group of images may constitute plagiarism from designer experts. We did not consider factors such as the **same author**, **open source materials**, and the **publish timestamp**. Therefore, if query image X and library image Y are annotated as "plagiarized", this does not mean the author of image Y has copied image X. We do not want this dataset to cause discomfort or confusion to any creator.

***If you are a creator:*** If you find your work in our dataset and do not want to use it for data training, please get in touch with us. We will delete your artwork immediately. We do not and will not use your work for commercial purposes.

***Data update:*** We promise to update the latest version of the plagiarism dataset on our website at regular intervals. Since many images in the dataset are manually annotated, please feel free to contact us if you find any problems (our contact information can be found on the didalab homepage). We will explore the plagiarism of design works in more fields in the future.
